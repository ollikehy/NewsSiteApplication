### How to use:
When starting the application you'll be directed to the "/news" page which has the option to add a new news story at the bottom of the page. When submitting a news story be sure to separate different authors and categories by a comma ex. "Jack, Jones". Also the image needs to be of .png type, otherwise it will not accept your input.

After submitting a news story you can view it by clicking it's heading and if you wish to edit it there's a link at the bottom of the page that let's you edit said news story.

After adding more news stories you can view a list of all news stories and trending news by clicking the links in the navigation bar up top. The frontpage is by default the latest five news stories added to the site.
